# CryoDrive - The ever running nitrogen powered vehicle

This MOF induced nitrogen-powered engine is a concept that utilizes the expansion of nitrogen gas to generate mechanical work.
 Nitrogen gas is readily available in the Earth's atmosphere, making it an attractive option for a sustainable eco-friendly and renewable power source.
The idea is to create a MOF induced system that captures and compresses atmospheric nitrogen, then releases it in a controlled manner to drive pistons or turbines, converting the stored energy into mechanical work and giving back nitrogen as an exhaust to atmosphere


## Problem Statement

Traditional transportation systems heavily rely on fossil fuels, leading to significant environmental issues such as air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Conventional vehicles contribute to climate change and health problems, impacting the quality of life for people worldwide. Additionally, electric vehicles face limitations in terms of range and charging infrastructure, hindering their widespread adoption. There is a pressing need for an innovative, eco-friendly, and continuous power source for vehicles to reduce emissions, minimize environmental impact, and improve overall transportation sustainability.

## Proposed Solution

Introducing CryoDrive: The Ever-Running Nitrogen-Powered Vehicle. This revolutionary concept draws in air, compresses and extracts liquid nitrogen, providing a continuous and sustainable power source. With zero emissions and extended range, the CryoDrive vehicle sets new standards for environmentally-friendly and efficient mobility. Quiet and safe, it eliminates the need for traditional refueling stops, offering an uninterrupted transportation experience. Join us in the journey towards a greener future.

## Working Principle 
The Cryodrive’s heat exchanger pulls liquid nitrogen from an insulated fuel tank through a series of aluminum tubing coils and specially designed pipes. Engine exhaust and outside air are circulated around the coils and pipes to gradually warm up the nitrogen from a minus 320 F liquid to an ambient-temperature gas.
"The heat exchanger is like the radiator of a car, but it acts in the opposite way, Instead of using air to cool water, it uses air to boil liquid nitrogen into nitrogen gas.”
The conversion from liquid to gas expands the volume of the nitrogen 700 times, building sufficient pressure to turn an air motor much like pressure from burning gasoline drives an internal combustion engine.
Inside the engine, liquid nitrogen travels from the storage tank to the heat exchanger. As it expands, air pressure builds. The gas powers pistons connected to a crankshaft in the air motor, which propels the car.

## Equations 

Operation of liquid-nitrogen fueled, regenerative, closed Brayton cycle cryogenic heat engine is illustrate. Considering adiabatic expander and compressor, the specific energy provided by the system is 
given by W = egµ (eewe-wc/ec) ……(1) 
Here, µ = AεL/Rt cold(pε-1)] ……(2) is the ratio of the working fluid mass flow rate to the liquid 
nitrogen vaporization rate.
T cold is the temperature of the heat single. 
P is the ratio of the absolute pressures on the high and low 
pressure sides. 
L = liquid nitrogen’s latent heat of vaporization. 
R = 8314 J/mol-K universal gas constant 
ε = 1-1 /r r = working fluid’s ratio of specific heat 
capacities at constant pressure and constant volume.
The ideal specific energy provided by an adiabatic expander 
is 
 We =RThot (1-p-ε)/[A.ε] ……….(3) 
That = temperature of heat source 
The ideal work done by an adiabatic compressor per unit 
mass of gas is 
Wc = RTcold (Pε-1)(A.ε) ……(4) 
By combining equations we get 
 W = egL [eep-ε (Thot / Tcold) - (1/ec)]  ……..(5) 
 The equation (5) considers the energy available 
from using liquid nitrogen as a heat sink. The cold nitrogen 
gas that is produced by vaporizing liquid nitrogen can be 
used a heat sink as well.
